# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you've crossed a gap in the space-time continuum and ended up here, don't panic.

Ether is a Discord bot with a bit of a 50s vibe (maybe that explains why you're here). But don't go away, Ether is still quite modern, it has a dashboard (not yet) and a music system more advanced than vinyl!

Unfortunately it is still in development but it is intended to be entirely free and wants to remain open source. To help him in this difficult task, you can contribute to the different repositories of this organization or make a small tip ðŸ‘€.

Ether plans to become an online bot accessible to everyone. Maybe one day we'll get there...

Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it. Feel free to have a look around here from time to time, new things may emerge!
